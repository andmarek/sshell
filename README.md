# Sshell
- A simple shell I'm making (hence sshell) to learn more about forking
  processes, syscalls, and systems programming in general in C.  Hoping to add
  some decent functionality and maybe re-write in Go (or Rust for the meme).

# Ideas:
- Make this so you can press a button to enter in multiple commands
    - Delegete them to line structs and execute them after.
- Allows users to specify how they want the line to appear e.g: "$ "
