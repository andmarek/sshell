# Sshell
- A simple shell I'm making (hence sshell) to learn more about forking
  processes, syscalls, and systems programming in general in C.  I'm following https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/ loosely (trying to make improvements).  Hoping to add
  some decent functionality and maybe re-write in Go (or Rust for the meme).
